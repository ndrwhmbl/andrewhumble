# Hi there, I'm Andrew Humble

I'm an AV Systems Designer turned aspiring Web/App/Game Developer. With 12+ years of experience designing complex technology systems for live events, churches, and corporate environments, I'm now bringing that same systems thinking into the world of software.

I'm currently expanding my skills in:
- **Web Development** â€“ JavaScript, Node.js, React, MongoDB
- **Cloud + Deployment** â€“ AWS (basic), GitHub Actions
- **Game Dev** â€“ Unity (C#), creative logic and interaction

I'm passionate about:
- Building clean, human-centered tech systems
- Remote work and global collaboration
- Learning languages (Swedish), exploring new cultures
- Investing with purpose and impact

I'm currently open to:
- Junior/Remote dev roles (Web or Game)
- Freelance or part-time AV system consulting
- Companies offering **relocation to Sweden or Norway**
